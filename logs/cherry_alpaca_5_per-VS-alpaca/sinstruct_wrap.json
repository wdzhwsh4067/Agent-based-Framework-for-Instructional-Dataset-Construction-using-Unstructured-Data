Where each step in the chain is dependent on the previous step, and the output of one step is the input of the next step. So, for example, if we're trying to find the sum of all the numbers in an array, we could think of it as a chain of steps:\n\n1. Iterate through the array and store the sum of each element in a variable.\n2. Add the current sum to the sum of the previous element in the array.\n3. Return the final sum.\n\nThis way of thinking about the problem can help us to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable chunks, and can help us to identify any dependencies between the steps.",

            "Answer1": "Mathematics and art have a long and intertwined history. Mathematics has been used by artists since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

It also seeks to ensure that producers have access to markets and are not exploited by middlemen. \n\nThe movement has grown in recent years, with more and more companies and consumers embracing the idea of fair trade. This has led to the development of fair trade certification programs, which ensure that products meet certain standards. \n\nThe idea of fair trade has also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right. Proponents of this idea argue that trade is essential for economic development and that it should be treated as a basic human right.

These include an empty beer can, a match, a thermometer, a small piece of wood, a piece of wire, a nail, and a small amount of water.\n\nThe next step is to poke a small hole in the center of the beer can lid with the nail. Then, light a match and hold it near the hole to create a small amount of smoke. This will help to create a vacuum inside the can.\n\nNext, fill the can with a small amount of water. Place the thermometer in the water and heat the can over a small fire until the thermometer reads 140\u00b0F. This will create steam inside the can.\n\nOnce the can is heated, insert the small piece of wood into the opening and use the wire to secure it in place. This will act as a valve to control the flow of steam.\n\nFinally, attach the small piece of wood to the nail and place it in the center of the can lid. This will act as a piston and will move up and down as the steam is released.\n\nWhen the steam is released, the piston will push the air out of the can, creating a vacuum and drawing in more air. This will cause the thermometer to drop, showing that the engine is working.",

Insert a small piece of wire through the hole and twist it into a loop.\n6. Use the loop to hang the can from a hook.\n7. Place a small amount of water in the can and light it using a match or lighter.\n8. As the water boils, the steam will fill the can and make the engine move."

            "Answer2": "In German, verbs must agree with their subject in both number and gender. Therefore, it is important to end the verb in the correct form to indicate the number and gender of the subject.

We will assume that x is a negative integer or a solution to x+3<4, and show that this leads to a contradiction. \n\nFirst, we will consider the case where x is a negative integer. Since x is a negative integer, this implies that x+3 is less than 4. This means that x+3<4, which is equivalent to -x-3<4, or -x<-1. This is a contradiction, since -x is a negative number and cannot be less than -1. \n\nNow, we will consider the case where x is a solution to x+3>4. This means that x>0 and x>12. We will first show that x>0. Since x is a solution to x+3>4, this implies that x+3>4. This means that x>-1, which is equivalent to x>0. \n\nWe will now show that x>12. Since x is a solution to x+3>4, this implies that x>12. This is because if x<12, then x+3<4, which is a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, we have shown that if x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12. This completes the proof.",
            "Answer2": "If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12. \n\nProof: \nIf x is a positive integer, then it is greater than 0. \nIf x is a solution to x+3>4, then it is greater than 12, since 12 is the smallest solution to x+3>4. \nTherefore, x>0 and x>12."

Participants slept for one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, and researchers measured their heart rate and blood sugar levels.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",

            "Answer1": "English constituency parsing is a task in natural language processing that involves identifying the grammatical roles of words in a sentence. It involves identifying the subject, verb, object, and other roles of words in a sentence. For example, given the sentence \"The boy gave the ball to the girl\", the constituency parser would identify \"the boy\" as the subject, \"gave\" as the verb, \"the ball\" as the direct object, and \"the girl\" as the indirect object.",
            "Answer2": "English constituency parsing is a task in natural language processing that requires a program to identify the syntactic categories of each word in a sentence. This task presents specific challenges because the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes."

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training.

FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up. We find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains.
